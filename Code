ðŸ›‘1.Apply aggregate functions on numeric columns
//Code
-- Count total number of books
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalBooks FROM Books;

-- Find the average published year of all books
SELECT AVG(PublishedYear) AS AverageYear FROM Books;

-- Count total number of members
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalMembers FROM Members;

-- Get minimum and maximum published year
SELECT MIN(PublishedYear) AS OldestBook, MAX(PublishedYear) AS NewestBook FROM Books;

 ðŸ›‘2.Use GROUP BY to categorize
//Code
-- Count number of books in each category
SELECT CategoryID, COUNT(*) AS BooksInCategory
FROM Books
GROUP BY CategoryID;

-- Count number of loans per member
SELECT MemberID, COUNT(*) AS TotalLoans
FROM Loans
GROUP BY MemberID;
 ðŸ›‘3.Filter groups using HAVING
//Code
-- Show only categories with more than 1 book
SELECT CategoryID, COUNT(*) AS BooksInCategory
FROM Books
GROUP BY CategoryID
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Show members who have borrowed more than 1 book
SELECT MemberID, COUNT(*) AS TotalLoans
FROM Loans
GROUP BY MemberID
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
